# FastCanvas

FastCanvas is a direct-to-JS Canvas call that takes all the draws and combines them into a single ending Draw() call. This can run reasonably close to a JS-native canvas call and duplicates the JS syntax for canvas. This means you can copy over documentation from Mozilla or something similar and have it work directly (with some exceptions that I note). 

Use [this wiki](https://wiki.codyhowell.dev/fastcanvas) to help you get set up and to see all the implemented methods! I try to include good XML comments in code as well.

FastCanvas provides an interface between C# and an HTML Canvas. It processes everything in one go, with passthroughs 
for all the common methods that I use, and in the future hope to get all of them in the spec. 

The wiki can be found at (this link)[https://wiki.codyhowell.dev/fastcanvas], and will walk through all the steps 
to get started. You need this package, a script link, and an IJSRuntime object in your Razor component, and then 
this class will help you do the rest.
